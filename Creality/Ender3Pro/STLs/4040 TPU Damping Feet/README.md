# 4040 TPU Damping Feet

Needed to raise the Ender 3 to fit an [expanded electronics box](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4107156). Wanted something more sturdy than was available that also aligned flush with the electronics box and some custom 4040 endcaps (4mm). The feet follow the extrusion profile and should not require any adhesives.
